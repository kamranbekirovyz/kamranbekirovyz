👋 Hi there! I'm Kamran, a Senior Flutter Developer with over 5+ years of experience. I've participated in development of more than 80 mobile applications, along with several plugins and packages for Flutter.

🌱 I'm currently working on several open-source packages and my indie mobile app ideas *por el arte* (for the art of it).
